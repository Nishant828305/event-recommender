## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nishant828305/event-recommender.git
cd event-recommender

Create virtual environment

python -m venv venv


Activate virtual environment

Windows PowerShell:

.\venv\Scripts\activate


Linux / Mac:

source venv/bin/activate


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


#  to run this module
cd C:\OneDrive\Desktop\AI-agent\event-recommender
python  src/main.py


▶️ Usage

Example usage once dependencies are installed:

from src.recommender import EventRecommender

# Initialize model
model = EventRecommender()

# Get recommendations for user
user_id = "example"
results = model.get_recommendations(user_id)

print("Recommended Events:", results)


Adjust code based on how your recommender classes and data loaders are implemented.

🧠 How It Works

Load user and event data from datasets (CSV / JSON etc.)

Use preprocessing functions in src/data_loader.py

Generate recommendations using logic in src/recommender.py

(You can extend this logic to include ML algorithms or scoring functions.)

📦 Dependencies

Dependencies required — listed in requirements.txt:

# Example
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn


Make sure all needed packages are in your requirements.txt.

📈 Future Improvements

Add dataset examples (CSV files)

Build a GUI / web UI (Flask / Streamlit)

Improve recommendation algorithm

Add evaluation metrics (precision, recall etc.)
